Maritime Navigator üö¢

Maritime Navigator is an application designed to predict maritime traffic conditions on specific routes, given weather conditions and the desired date. It utilizes TabNet, a deep learning architecture, to analyze data and generate predictions. The application bridges its backend and frontend seamlessly using Gradio, enabling easy interaction and visualization.

Features ‚ú®

-	Predicts maritime traffic for specific routes on a given day.
-	Incorporates weather conditions into predictions.
- 	Uses the TabNet architecture for accurate and efficient deep learning.
-	Interactive Gradio interface for user-friendly predictions.
-	Fully hosted and runnable on Google Colab.

How It Works üîç

The workflow involves two stages:

1.	Training the Model:
-	A TabNet deep learning model is trained on maritime data to learn traffic patterns under various weather conditions.
2.	Making Predictions:
-	The trained model predicts maritime traffic for a given route and date using user-provided data.

Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è

-	A Google account to access Google Colab.
-	Basic familiarity with running code in Google Colab.

How to Run the Application üöÄ

Step 1: Train the Model

1.	Open the following Colab notebook:

		https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1taEETPduFLiJBN4OU0uRzq3mPtxl6J7D?usp=sharing

2.	Run each block of code sequentially:
-	Follow the prompts and ensure that all dependencies are installed.
-	At the end of execution, a trained model file (model.pt) will be downloaded to your computer.

Step 2: Use the Trained Model

1.	Open the second Colab notebook:
 
		https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1taEETPduFLiJBN4OU0uRzq3mPtxl6J7D?usp=sharing

2.	Run each block of code sequentially:
-	When prompted, upload the trained model file downloaded earlier (model.pt).
-	Provide the required data inputs (route, date, and weather conditions).
-	The code will process the inputs and display the maritime traffic predictions.

Experimentation ‚ö°

Feel free to experiment with different values in the dataset provided in the Prediction Notebook to observe how traffic predictions vary with input parameters.

Technologies Used üñ•Ô∏è

-	TabNet: Deep learning architecture for tabular data.
-	Gradio: Frontend framework for linking machine learning models to user interfaces.
-	Google Colab: Cloud-based environment for running Python code.

Future Improvements üöÄ

-	Expand prediction capabilities to include multiple routes simultaneously.
-	Integrate live weather data from external APIs for real-time predictions.
-	Deploy the application as a standalone web or mobile app.
