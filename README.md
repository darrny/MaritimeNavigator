1. Navigate to the first link. Run each block of code sequentially. At the end of the code, there should be a file downloaded to your computer
2. Navigate to the second link and run each block of code sequentially.
3. Colab will ask for a trained model file, upload the file that was downloaded earlier. The code will then use the model to predict the relevant data using the data provided in the code.
4. Feel free to test with other values for the data set.
